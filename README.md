# PredictiveAnalytics 
 Project Topic: Predictive Analytics In Event Management Using Machine Learning Tools And Techniques The idea behind the project: It has been noted that the use of both internal and external factors for attendance prediction provides valuable insights for event organizers to improve their event planning and decision-making. Internal factors such as social media, Entertainment, marketing efforts, and ticket prices have been extensively used in attendance prediction using machine learning tools. However, external factors are also crucial in predicting event attendance, but studies evaluating their impact on attendance prediction are scarce.   Project Aim: To develop a machine learning model that incorporates external factors as variables such as economic conditions and transportation options to predict sport event attendance. Kindly note: Use three Algorithms to test that the use of uncontrollable factors can be effectively use to predict event attendance.   You can focus on a particular country, sport that you think is best to use but please focus on all sort of data on economic conditions and Transportation options as variables, to make the work easier and specific.  Please I will also need the documentation as well to fix it in my report.  Thanks so much, I will be looking forward to hearing from you.
